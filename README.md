## 🛠 About the Project

This To-Do List App was built as part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
It focuses on creating a fully modular, single-page application (SPA) with best practices in project structure, JavaScript functionality, and front-end development.

Through this project, I practiced:
- DOM manipulation
- Object-oriented design
- Local Storage management
- Webpack bundling
